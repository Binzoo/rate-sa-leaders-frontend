            <p className="text-white">
              RateSA emerged from meaningful discussions about democratic
              participation in our beloved country. We asked: What if South
              African citizens could freely and anonymously evaluate their
              elected representatives? That question inspired this platform.
              We're an independent, non-partisan initiative empowering citizens
              to share their perspectives on political leaders based on
              performance, integrity, accountability, and public service. We
              believe South Africa's democracy flourishes when people's voices
              are heard beyond just election day.

                Our Mission
              </h2>
              <p className="text-white">
                RateSA is a platform built for the people of South Africa. Our
                goal is to make political accountability more accessible by
                giving citizens a simple way to rate and review their leaders.
                We aim to foster civic participation, promote transparency, and
                encourage constructive dialogue about governance in our rainbow
                nation.

                Why We Exist
              </h2>
              <p className="text-white">
                Too often, public voices are ignored between elections. RateSA
                empowers everyday South Africans to express their opinions and
                help shape the conversation on leadership and governance. By
                creating a space for citizen feedback, we hope to strengthen our
                democratic institutions and build a more responsive political
                culture.
